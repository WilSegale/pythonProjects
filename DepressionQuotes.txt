Hard times will make you grow.
Don't let your past determine your future.
You're allowed to scream, You're allowed to cry, but not to give up.
You will outlast your problems.
Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward. 
If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down. -Roy T. Bennett
Be patient and tough; someday this pain will be useful to you. -Ovid
Every day is a second chance.
You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it. -Margaret Thatcher
You think you deserve the pain that you have but you don't. What you deserve is love and someone to care for you
